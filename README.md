## How It Works

The frontend, built using Flask and standard web technologies, takes a user's search input and sends it to `bookclass.py`, which handles the logic for fetching and compiling book data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Google Books API Search**  
   The app queries the Google Books API to find a match for the searched title.

2. **Primary Data Extraction from GoogleBooks API**  
   - If a match is found, the book's title, author(s), description, and page count are extracted.  
   - If no match is found, the user is shown an error page displaying the top 5 closest matches from the Google Books API.

3. **Cover Image Retrieval**  
   W3slley's API is used to fetch a book cover image.

4. **Secondary Data Extraction from OpenBooks API**  
   The book is also queried on the OpenLibrary API to:
   - Locate a specific key associated with the book.  
   - Parse the `subjects` section to determine relevant genres.  
   - Identify the earliest available publication date.

5. **Display**  
   All gathered information is rendered and displayed to the user in a clean, responsive web interface.
